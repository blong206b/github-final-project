# github-final-project
IBM coursera github final project (part 3 of the full stack developer certification track)
The main purpose of this final project (capstone?) is to show that I understand the git commands and processes, such as
1) creating a repository
2) adding all the licenses, readme, code of conduct, etc.

There will be six URLs saved to Notepad for proof of work.

I'm not sure if there is more to the project. :)
