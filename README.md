# github-final-project
IBM coursera github final project (part 3 of the full stack developer certification track)
The main purpose of this final project (capstone?) is to show that I understand the git commands and processes, such as
1) creating a repository
2) adding all the licenses, readme, code of conduct, etc.

There will be six URLs saved to Notepad for proof of work.
